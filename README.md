## Installation

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.6)
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/darkshare.git
cd darkshare
```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting the IP Address

#### Configuring the IP Address
1. **Find an IP outside the DHCP range of your router**
   - Access your router's configuration page (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`) through a web browser.
   - Log in with your admin credentials.
   - Locate the DHCP settings section. Identify the DHCP range.
   - Choose an IP address outside this range (e.g., if the DHCP range is `192.168.1.100 - 192.168.1.200`, you can choose `192.168.1.201`).

2. **Assign IP to your PC/Host**
   - On **Windows**:
     - Go to `Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings`.
     - Right-click on the network adapter connected to your router and select `Properties`.
     - Select `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)` and click `Properties`.
     - Select `Use the following IP address` and enter your chosen IP (e.g., `192.168.1.201`). Set the Subnet mask, usually `255.255.255.0`, and Default gateway (your router’s IP, e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     - Open `System Preferences > Network`.
     - Select your active network connection and click `Advanced`.
     - Go to the `TCP/IP` tab. Set `Configure IPv4` to `Manually`.
     - Enter your chosen IP (e.g., `192.168.1.201`), Subnet mask (`255.255.255.0`), and Router (default gateway, e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

### Run the Application

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and set the following variables:

```env
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
IP_ADDRESS=192.168.1.201  # Your chosen static IP
```

Run the Flask application:

```bash
flask run --host=192.168.1.201
```

Access the application by navigating to `http://192.168.1.201:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage
- **File Upload**: Navigate to the upload section and select files to upload.
- **File Download**: Click on the file links to download them.
- **Copy and Paste**: Copy and paste text using clipboard functionalities.
- **File Deletion**: Delete files temporarily or permanently with a single confirmation.
